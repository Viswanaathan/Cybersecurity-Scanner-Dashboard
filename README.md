# Cybersecurity-Scanner-Dashboard
A lightweight Flask-based cybersecurity scanner that checks common ports on a target IP, grabs service banners, looks up known vulnerabilities (CVEs), traces GeoIP location, and provides security tips. Results are displayed in a dashboard and can be exported as a CSV for reporting or analysis.
